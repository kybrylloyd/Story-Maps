# Story-Maps
Story maps are visual tools used to outline narratives, incorporating elements like characters, settings, and plot points. They provide a structured overview of a story's progression, helping creators organize ideas and maintain coherence. Typically composed of key scenes or events arranged in a linear or branching format, story maps offer a holistic view of the narrative arc. These maps serve various purposes, from aiding in the writing process to facilitating discussions among collaborators. By visually mapping out story elements, creators can streamline storytelling and ensure consistency in themes and character development, enhancing the overall quality and impact of the narrative.
